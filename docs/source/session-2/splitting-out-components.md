title: Splitting our Components
---

Now we have a massive component rendering a ton of elements with a lot of reptition. Try it yourself, split the component into smaller components using nested components (`children`).

## Conclusion

Your `source` directory should look something like this:

```
./answers/session-2/source
├── components
│   └── YOUR COMPONENTS
├── images
│   └── dominion.jpg
├── index.html.ejs
└── index.jsx
```
