In this session we'll be learning to use "dumb" components to create a simple app in React.

To do this, we're going to take the page we made in the CSS Dojo and split it into components. If you haven't done the CSS Dojo, you can grab these files:

- [HTML Markup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahed/css-dojo/responsive/source/index.html)
- [CSS Stylesheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jahed/css-dojo/responsive/source/stylesheets/main.css)

If you want to skip the setup process from the previous session, you can checkout the [Project Template](https://github.com/jahed/react-dojo/tree/master/code).
