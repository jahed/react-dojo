After you've done all the set up, you should have a project directory which looks something like:

```
./react-dojo/
├── node_modules
├── source
│   ├── index.html.ejs
│   └── index.jsx
├── .babelrc
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

If you run the Dev Server and visit [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) you should see a "Hello, World!".
