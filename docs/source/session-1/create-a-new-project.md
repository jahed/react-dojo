title: Create a New Project
description: ""
---

Create a new directory:

```sh
mkdir react-dojo
cd react-dojo
```

Make it a Git repo:

```sh
git init
```

Make it a Node package. You can skip through the options it gives you.

```
npm init
```

This will create a `package.json` at the root of your project.
