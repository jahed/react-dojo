First things first. We're going to need to set up NodeJS. To check your current Node version, run:

```sh
node --version
```

If it doesn't run at all or you're on a version before `v6.x`, you'll need to install Node. You can either use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/), install it via your package manager of choice or use the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
