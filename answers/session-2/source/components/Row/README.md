# Row

A Row contains Columns and applies spacing between other components (including other Rows).

By assigning a `display: flex;` style on this component, it can dynamically adjust its content to either stretch, or in our case `wrap` (i.e. go onto the next line.

We can also use `flex` to easily switch from a `row` direction to a `column` direction for mobile layouts.
